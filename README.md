# jscout

A scouting platform based on [Statbotics](https://www.statbotics.io/) for FIRSTÂ® Tech Challenge.

See the website [here](https://jscout.jaiden.hackclub.app/).

> [!WARNING]
> I am not hosting it on the best place + I made it really inefficient, so it's probably going to be *slow*. Also all data is from the 2024-2025 season. Also EPA is down right now.

You can, for example, see data like this:

Or, you can see a recap of an event like this:
